# AdaPT: An interactive procedure for multiple testing with side information

AdaPT.R contains the code to implement AdaPT under the mixture model described in section 4.

gene_dosage_experiment.R contains the code to implement the experiment on GEOquery data as described in section 5. To reproduce it, just replace "your path" by the path of the directory storing AdaPT.R and then run the rest of the codes. The first half of the code is (almost) a copy of "http://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~rina/sabha/gene_drug_data_example.R". The second half of the code includes the implementation of AdaPT as well as plotting the figures in section 5 and Appendix C.
